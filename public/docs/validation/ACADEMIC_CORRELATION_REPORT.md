# Academic Correlation Report

**Report Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Analysis Period**: Last 90 days  
**Metric**: Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)

---

## Executive Summary

This report validates the Career Automation Insights Engine's APO (Automation Potential Opportunity) scoring system against established academic research on automation risk. We measure the correlation between our AI-generated APO scores and expert assessments from leading studies.

**Key Findings**:
- **Correlation Strength**: TBD (pending data population)
- **Sample Size**: TBD occupations matched
- **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.05 (target)
- **Interpretation**: Strong positive correlation indicates APO scores align with academic consensus

---

## Methodology

### Data Sources

**APO Scores**:
- Source: `public.apo_logs` table
- Generated by: `calculate-apo` Edge Function
- Model: Gemini 2.0 Flash with deterministic formula
- Factors: 11-factor weighted scoring (tasks, knowledge, skills, abilities, technologies, BLS trends, economics)

**Expert Assessments**:
- Source: `public.expert_assessments` table
- Studies included:
  1. **Frey & Osborne (2013)**: 702 occupations, computerization probability
  2. **Arntz et al. (2016)**: Task-based OECD estimates
  3. **McKinsey (2017)**: Sector automation potential

### Correlation Calculation

**Formula**: Pearson's r
```
r = Σ[(xi - x̄)(yi - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xi - x̄)² × Σ(yi - ȳ)²]
```

Where:
- xi = APO score for occupation i (0-100)
- yi = Expert probability for occupation i (0-100)
- x̄, ȳ = Sample means

**Interpretation**:
- r ≥ 0.70: Strong positive correlation
- 0.50 ≤ r < 0.70: Moderate correlation
- r < 0.50: Weak correlation (requires investigation)

## Results

### Overall Correlation

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Pearson r | **TBD** | ⏳ Pending |
| Sample Size (n) | **TBD** | ⏳ Pending |
| p-value | **TBD** | ⏳ Pending |
| 95% CI | **[TBD, TBD]** | ⏳ Pending |

**Note**: Results will populate after running:
```bash
supabase functions invoke validate-apo --body '{"sinceDays": 90}'
```

### Correlation by Study

| Study | Occupations | APO Mean | Expert Mean | Pearson r | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Frey & Osborne (2013) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⏳ |
| Arntz et al. (2016) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⏳ |
| McKinsey (2017) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⏳ |

### Scatter Plot Analysis

**Expected Pattern**:
- Strong linear relationship between APO and expert scores
- Points clustered near diagonal (y = x line)
- Minimal outliers (>2 SD from regression line)

**Actual Plot**: TBD (generate after data population)

---

## Validation Insights

### Agreement Examples

**High Agreement Occupations** (APO ≈ Expert):
- TBD: Software Developers (APO: XX%, Expert: YY%)
- TBD: Data Entry Keyers (APO: XX%, Expert: YY%)
- TBD: Accountants (APO: XX%, Expert: YY%)

### Disagreement Cases

**APO Higher than Expert**:
- Possible reasons: Recent AI advances (LLMs, computer vision) not reflected in older studies
- Example: TBD

**APO Lower than Expert**:
- Possible reasons: Economic viability discount, regulatory friction, human-in-loop requirements
- Example: TBD

## Comparison to Baseline

### Ablation Study

| Model Variant | Pearson r | Δ from Full Model |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Full APO** (11 factors + external signals) | TBD | — |
| APO without BLS trends | TBD | TBD |
| APO without economics | TBD | TBD |
| APO without CI | TBD | TBD |
| Simple task count baseline | TBD | TBD |

**Interpretation**: External signals (BLS, economics) should improve correlation by ≥0.05 points.

## Statistical Significance

### Hypothesis Test

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No correlation between APO and expert scores (ρ = 0)  
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Positive correlation exists (ρ > 0)

**Test Statistic**:
```
t = r × √(n - 2) / √(1 - r²)
```

**Degrees of Freedom**: n - 2

**Critical Value**: t₀.₀₅ (one-tailed)

**Result**: TBD

---

## Limitations

1. **Temporal Mismatch**: Expert studies from 2013-2017; APO reflects 2024-2025 technology landscape
2. **Sample Overlap**: Not all O*NET occupations have expert assessments
3. **Granularity**: Experts assess entire occupations; APO scores individual tasks then aggregates
4. **Methodology Differences**: Experts use econometric models; APO uses LLM + deterministic formula

---

## Recommendations

### For r ≥ 0.70 (Strong Correlation)
✅ **Validation Passed**
- Publish results in nomination materials
- Use as evidence of technical rigor
- Continue quarterly revalidation

### For 0.50 ≤ r < 0.70 (Moderate Correlation)
⚠️ **Acceptable with Caveats**
- Document known differences (temporal, methodological)
- Highlight areas of strong agreement
- Plan prompt refinements to improve alignment

### For r < 0.50 (Weak Correlation)
❌ **Requires Investigation**
- Review prompt engineering and factor weights
- Check for systematic biases (industry, wage level, task type)
- Consider ensemble with rule-based model
- Collect additional expert labels for fine-tuning

## Next Steps

1. **Populate Expert Data**:
   ```sql
   -- Import Frey & Osborne (2013) data
   INSERT INTO expert_assessments (occupation_code, source, automation_probability)
   VALUES
     ('11-1011.00', 'Frey_Osborne_2013', 1.5),
     ('15-1252.00', 'Frey_Osborne_2013', 4.2),
     -- ... 700+ more rows
   ```

2. **Run Validation**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions invoke validate-apo --body '{"sinceDays": 90}'
   ```

3. **Query Results**:
   ```sql
   SELECT metric_name, value, sample_size, created_at
   FROM validation_metrics
   WHERE metric_name = 'apo_vs_academic_pearson_r'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

4. **Update Report**: Replace "TBD" values with actual results

5. **Generate Visualizations**:
   - Scatter plot (APO vs Expert)
   - Residual plot
   - Correlation by occupation category
