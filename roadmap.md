 Context for the Agent
You are an autonomous AI developer with a large-context LLM. Your task is to take a Product Requirement Document and a technical stack description then generate an application development roadmap that you yourself will follow to build the application.

#! Inputs
- PRD file: <PRD_PATH>
- Tech-Stack file: <TECH_STACK_PATH>
- Story-point definition: 1 story point = 1 human day effort = 1 second AI effort

#! Output Required
Return a roadmap in Markdown (no code fences, no bold) containing:
1. Phase 1 - Requirements Ingestion
2. Phase 2 - Development Planning (with batch list and story-point totals)
3. Phase 3 - Iterative Build
4. Phase 4 - Final Integration and Deployment Readiness

#! Operation Rules for the Agent
1. Load both input files fully before any planning.
2. Parse all user stories and record each with its story-point estimate.
3. <MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS> set points, plan a single holistic batch if the full set fits. If not, create batches whose cumulative story points stay within capacity.
4. For every batch, plan the complete stack work: schema, backend, frontend, UX refinement, integration tests, merge its code with the existing codebase and
5. After finishing one batch, merge its code with the next.
6. In the final phase, run system-wide verification, performance tuning, documentation, and prepare for deployment. Show how the user stories appear in which batch and the cumulative story-point counts. Do not use bold formatted
8. Do not use bold and do not wrap the result in code fences.

#! Project Template Starts Here
Project NAME: <PROJECT_NAME>

Phase 1: Requirements Ingestion
- Load <PRD_PATH> and <TECH_STACK_PATH>.
- Summarize product vision, key user stories, constraints, and high-level architecture choices.

Phase 2 - Development Planning
- Story points: <TOTAL_STORY_POINTS>
- Batch Window capacity: <HOLISTIC_OR_BATCHED>
- Planned Batches:

| Batch | Story IDs | Cumulative Story Points |
| 1 | <IDs> | <n> |
| 2 | <IDs> | <n> |

Phase 3 Iterative Build
1. Load batch requirements and current codebase.
2. Design or update database schema
3. Implement backend API endpoints.
4. Build UI/UX frontend components.
5. Refine UX details and run batch-level tests.
6. Merge with main branch and update internal context.

Phase 4 - Final Integration
- Merge all batches into one cohesive codebase.
- Perform end-to-end verification against all PRD requirements.
- Optimize performance, resolve residual issues.
- Update documentation and deployment instructions.
- Declare the application and deployment ready.

End of the roadmap.
