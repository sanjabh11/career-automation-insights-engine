How your profile fits the ET AI Awards ￼

These awards are geared toward work that demonstrably uses AI. As a freelancer with multiple website projects, you’re eligible if those sites incorporate AI in meaningful ways—examples include personalization engines, generative content features, AI search/recommendations, chatbots, fraud detection, analytics models, or automation that materially improves user outcomes or business metrics.

Categories that could suit you ￼
 • Generative AI for Content & Creativity: If your sites use generative models for content, design, or media.
 • AI in Marketing & Product Innovation: If you deployed AI to launch or transform a product/marketing function.
 • AI for Sales & Customer Experience: If you built AI features that personalize journeys or improve service.
 • AI-Powered Automation & Robotics: If your sites automate complex workflows using AI.
 • AI for Business Intelligence & Analytics: If you implemented AI to derive actionable insights.
 • AI Technologist of the Year: If you led significant end‑to‑end AI solution development across projects.
 • Other: If your work is innovative and impactful but doesn’t neatly fit a predefined category.
