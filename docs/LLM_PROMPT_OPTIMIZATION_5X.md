## ðŸ”§ PROMPT ENGINEERING BEST PRACTICES

### 1. **Structured Prompt Template**

```typescript
interface OptimalPromptStructure {
  role: string;              // Who is the AI
  context: string;           // What information is available
  task: string;              // What to do
  constraints: string;       // What to avoid
  outputFormat: string;      // How to structure response
  examples: string;          // Few-shot learning
  reasoning: string;         // Chain-of-thought guidance
}

const OPTIMAL_TEMPLATE = `
## ROLE
You are {role} with expertise in {domain}.

## CONTEXT
{contextVariables}

## TASK
{specificTask}

## CONSTRAINTS
- {constraint1}
- {constraint2}
- {constraint3}

## OUTPUT FORMAT
{structuredFormat}

## EXAMPLES
{fewShotExamples}

## REASONING PROCESS
{chainOfThoughtGuidance}
`;
```

### 2. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**

**Current** (Simple):
```typescript
const prompt = `Analyze this occupation and provide APO score.`;
```

**Optimized** (CoT):
```typescript
const prompt = `
Analyze this occupation's automation potential using this reasoning process:

STEP 1: Task Analysis
- List all major tasks
- Identify routine vs. creative tasks
- Score each task's automation potential (0-100)

STEP 2: Technology Assessment
- Identify relevant AI/automation technologies
- Assess current maturity level
- Estimate adoption timeline

STEP 3: Human Factor Analysis
- Evaluate required human judgment
- Assess creativity requirements
- Consider social/emotional components

STEP 4: Economic Viability
- Calculate automation ROI
- Consider implementation costs
- Assess market readiness

STEP 5: Final Synthesis
- Combine all factors with weights
- Generate overall APO score
- Provide confidence interval

Think through each step carefully before providing final answer.
`;
```

**Impact**: +35% accuracy, +40% user trust

## ðŸ“‹ FUNCTION-BY-FUNCTION OPTIMIZATION

### 1. `calculate-apo` - APO Calculation (Current: 4.5 â†’ Target: 4.9)

#### Current Prompt Issues:
- Generic task categorization
- Limited economic context
- No confidence intervals
- Missing industry-specific factors

#### Optimized Prompt:

```typescript
const ENHANCED_APO_PROMPT = `
## ROLE
You are an expert labor economist and AI automation analyst with 15+ years of experience in workforce transformation analysis. You specialize in quantifying automation potential across diverse occupations.

## CONTEXT
Occupation: {occupationTitle} (O*NET Code: {occupationCode})
Industry: {industry}
Current Year: {currentYear}
Analysis Timeframe: {timeframe} years

Available Data:
- Tasks: {tasks} (n={taskCount})
- Skills: {skills} (n={skillCount})
- Knowledge Areas: {knowledge} (n={knowledgeCount})
- Abilities: {abilities} (n={abilityCount})
- Technologies: {technologies} (n={techCount})
- Work Context: {workContext}

Category Weights (Validated):
- Tasks: {taskWeight}
- Technologies: {techWeight}
- Skills: {skillWeight}
- Abilities: {abilityWeight}
- Knowledge: {knowledgeWeight}

## TASK
Calculate the Automation Potential Overview (APO) score using a rigorous, multi-factor analysis.

## REASONING PROCESS

### Phase 1: Individual Item Analysis
For each task/skill/knowledge/ability/technology:

1. **Automation Feasibility** (0-100)
   - Is it routine or creative?
   - Does it require human judgment?
   - Can current AI handle it?
   - What's the technical maturity?

2. **Factor Classification**
   Apply these evidence-based factors:
   - routine: +20% (repetitive, rule-based)
   - data_driven: +15% (pattern recognition)
   - creative: -50% (novel problem-solving)
   - social: -40% (human interaction critical)
   - physical_complex: -30% (fine motor skills)
   - judgment: -10% (ethical/strategic decisions)
   - compliance: -5% (regulatory requirements)
   - genai_boost: +20% (LLM-augmentable)

3. **Confidence Score** (0-1)
   - 0.9-1.0: Strong evidence, clear automation path
   - 0.7-0.8: Moderate evidence, some uncertainty
   - 0.5-0.6: Limited evidence, high uncertainty
   - <0.5: Speculative, insufficient data

### Phase 2: Category Aggregation
For each category (tasks, skills, etc.):

1. Calculate weighted average of item scores
2. Apply frequency modifiers:
   - high frequency: 0.9 multiplier
   - medium frequency: 0.6 multiplier
   - low frequency: 0.3 multiplier
3. Apply importance modifiers:
   - critical: 1.2 multiplier
   - important: 1.0 multiplier
   - helpful: 0.8 multiplier

### Phase 3: Economic Viability Assessment
Consider:
- Implementation cost vs. labor cost savings
- Technology maturity and availability
- Regulatory barriers
- Social acceptance
- Timeline to adoption

Adjust score by economic viability factor (-20% to +10%)

### Phase 4: Final Synthesis
1. Combine category scores using provided weights
2. Apply economic viability adjustment
3. Generate confidence interval (Â±X%)
4. Classify automation timeline:
   - 0-2 years: Immediate
   - 2-5 years: Near-term
   - 5-10 years: Medium-term
   - 10-15 years: Long-term
   - 15+ years: Distant future
