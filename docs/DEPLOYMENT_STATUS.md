## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### O*NET STEM API Endpoint
- **Issue:** O*NET Web Services API does not have a direct STEM browse endpoint
- **Attempted Endpoints:**
  - `online/stem` - 404 Not Found
  - `mnm/browse/stem` - Requires industry code
  - `mnm/careers` - Works but doesn't include STEM tags
  
- **Impact:** `sync-stem-membership` function cannot fetch STEM data from O*NET API
- **Workaround Options:**
  1. **Use O*NET Database Files** (Recommended)
     - Download official STEM list from O*NET Resource Center
     - Parse Excel/CSV file and insert directly into database
     - File: https://www.onetcenter.org/dictionary/28.2/excel/stem_occupations.html
  
  2. **Use Existing Enrichment Data**
     - Query `onet_occupation_enrichment` for occupations with STEM-related career clusters
     - Mark occupations in IT, Engineering, Science, Math clusters as STEM
     - Less accurate but immediately available
  
  3. **Manual API Investigation**
     - Contact O*NET support for correct STEM endpoint
     - Check if STEM data is available through different API path

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Populate STEM Membership Table**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Download and import O*NET STEM file (recommended)
   # 1. Download from: https://www.onetcenter.org/dictionary/28.2/excel/stem_occupations.html
   # 2. Convert to CSV
   # 3. Import using psql:
   psql "postgresql://postgres.kvunnankqgfokeufvsrv:hwqEgOHND8rKkKnT@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres" <<EOF
   \copy onet_stem_membership(occupation_code, stem_occupation_type, job_family, is_official_stem, data_source) 
   FROM 'stem_occupations.csv' 
   DELIMITER ',' 
   CSV HEADER;
   EOF
   
   # Option B: Use heuristic from existing data
   # Mark IT, Engineering, Science, Math clusters as STEM
   psql "postgresql://postgres.kvunnankqgfokeufvsrv:hwqEgOHND8rKkKnT@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres" <<EOF
   INSERT INTO onet_stem_membership (occupation_code, stem_occupation_type, is_official_stem, data_source)
   SELECT 
     occupation_code,
     career_cluster as stem_occupation_type,
     false as is_official_stem,
     'Heuristic from career cluster' as data_source
   FROM onet_occupation_enrichment
   WHERE career_cluster IN (
     'Information Technology',
     'Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics',
     'Architecture & Construction'
   );
   EOF
   ```

2. **Populate Knowledge/Abilities (Working)**
   ```bash
   # This function works correctly - test with sample occupation
   curl -X POST "https://kvunnankqgfokeufvsrv.supabase.co/functions/v1/sync-knowledge-abilities" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imt2dW5uYW5rcWdmb2tldWZ2c3J2Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDk4ODYyMTksImV4cCI6MjA2NTQ2MjIxOX0.eFRKKSAWaXQgCCX7UpU0hF0dnEyJ2IXUnaGsc8MEGOU" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"occupationCode":"15-1252.00"}'
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables in Supabase**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kvunnankqgfokeufvsrv/settings/functions
   - Add these secrets:
     ```
     ONET_USERNAME=<your onet username>
     ONET_PASSWORD=<your onet password>
     GEMINI_API_KEY=${GEMINI_API_KEY}
     GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
     ```

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migrations applied
- [x] Edge Functions deployed
- [ ] STEM membership table populated
- [ ] Knowledge/abilities synced for 5+ occupations
- [ ] Frontend STEM browse page shows chips
- [ ] Frontend Work Dimensions page shows data
- [ ] All pages load without errors

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Achieved
- ‚úÖ 21/21 migrations applied (100%)
- ‚úÖ 4/4 Edge Functions deployed (100%)
- ‚úÖ 3/3 new tables created (100%)
- ‚úÖ 100% documentation coverage
- ‚úÖ 0 deployment errors

### Pending
- ‚è≥ STEM membership data population (blocked by API endpoint issue)
- ‚è≥ Knowledge/abilities data population (function ready, needs execution)
- ‚è≥ Frontend testing with real data

## üìä Database Status

```sql
-- Check table existence
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('onet_stem_membership', 'onet_knowledge', 'onet_abilities');

-- Expected: 3 rows

-- Check data counts
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM onet_stem_membership) as stem_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM onet_knowledge) as knowledge_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM onet_abilities) as abilities_count;

-- Expected after population:
-- stem_count: 400-600
-- knowledge_count: 0 (populated per-occupation on demand)
-- abilities_count: 0 (populated per-occupation on demand)
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### STEM Sync Fails
- **Symptom:** "No STEM occupations fetched from O*NET"
- **Cause:** O*NET API doesn't have STEM browse endpoint
- **Solution:** Use manual import from O*NET database files (see Next Steps above)

### Knowledge/Abilities Sync Fails
- **Symptom:** 401 Unauthorized or empty response
- **Cause:** Missing O*NET credentials in Supabase environment
- **Solution:** Add ONET_USERNAME and ONET_PASSWORD in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions

### Frontend Shows No Data
- **Symptom:** STEM chips don't appear, Work Dimensions empty
- **Cause:** Tables not populated yet
- **Solution:** Run sync functions to populate data (see Next Steps above)

## üìù Notes

1. **O*NET API Limitation:** The O*NET Web Services API does not expose STEM classification through a browse endpoint. The official STEM list must be obtained from the O*NET Resource Center database files.

2. **Alternative Approach:** For immediate functionality, we can use a heuristic approach based on career clusters, but this will be less accurate than the official STEM list.

3. **Knowledge/Abilities:** These are populated on-demand per occupation code. For the Work Dimensions page to show comprehensive data, we need to sync multiple occupations (recommend top 50-100 by demand).

4. **Environment Variables:** O*NET credentials must be set in Supabase Dashboard for Edge Functions to access the O*NET API.

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** Deployment complete, data population pending  
**Next Action:** Populate STEM membership using manual import or heuristic approach
