## üîß Step 1: Fix Data Issues (5 minutes)

### Run This in Supabase SQL Editor:

**File:** `supabase/data/imports/VERIFY_AND_FIX.sql`

This script will:
1. Check STEM count (currently 2, should be 100)
2. Remove duplicate career clusters (32 ‚Üí 16)
3. Sync STEM data from `onet_stem_membership` to `onet_occupation_enrichment`
4. Show final counts

**Expected After Running:**
- STEM: 100
- Job Zones: 5
- Career Clusters: 16
- Hot Technologies: 40

---

## üß™ Step 2: Test Endpoints (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/sanjayb/Documents/newrepo/career-automation-insights-engine
./test_endpoints.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Testing STEM Filter ===
"db"
100

=== Testing Job Zones ===
"db"
5

=== Testing Hot Technologies ===
"db"
40

=== Testing Career Clusters ===
"db"
16
```

If any show `null` or `"onet_fallback"`, the Edge Functions need redeployment:

```bash
supabase functions deploy search-occupations
supabase functions deploy browse-job-zones
supabase functions deploy hot-technologies
supabase functions deploy browse-career-clusters
```

## üé® Step 3: Build & View Frontend (5 minutes)

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```
