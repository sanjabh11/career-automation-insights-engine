# 🎯 Complete Action Plan - Fix & Deploy

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Fix Data Issues First

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic & Fix Script (5 minutes)

**File:** `supabase/data/imports/DIAGNOSE_AND_FIX.sql`

**What it does:**
1. Diagnoses why STEM shows 2 instead of 100
2. Checks if `onet_stem_membership` has 100 records
3. Deletes ALL career clusters and re-inserts clean 16
4. Updates STEM flags in `onet_occupation_enrichment`
5. Shows final counts

**Expected Result:**
- STEM: 100
- STEM Membership: 100
- Job Zones: 5
- Career Clusters: 16
- Hot Technologies: 40

**If STEM Membership shows < 100:**
Re-run `01_import_stem_complete.sql` first, then run `DIAGNOSE_AND_FIX.sql` again.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Verify Data (2 minutes)

Run this query:

```sql
SELECT 'STEM' as dataset, COUNT(*) as count FROM onet_occupation_enrichment WHERE is_stem = true
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Job Zones', COUNT(*) FROM onet_job_zones
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Career Clusters', COUNT(*) FROM onet_career_clusters
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Hot Technologies', COUNT(*) FROM onet_hot_technologies_master;
```

**Must show:**
- STEM: 100 ✅
- Job Zones: 5 ✅
- Career Clusters: 16 ✅
- Hot Technologies: 40 ✅

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Test Endpoints (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/sanjayb/Documents/newrepo/career-automation-insights-engine
./test_endpoints.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== Testing STEM Filter ===
"db"
100

=== Testing Job Zones ===
"db"
5

=== Testing Hot Technologies ===
"db"
40

=== Testing Career Clusters ===
"db"
16
```

**If showing null or 0:**
Edge Functions may need redeployment or there's a schema mismatch. Check function logs.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### STEM Still Shows 2
**Cause:** `onet_stem_membership` table is empty or has only 2 records
**Fix:** Re-run `01_import_stem_complete.sql` to insert all 100 records

### Career Clusters Still Shows 32
**Cause:** Duplicates not deleted properly
**Fix:** Run `DELETE FROM onet_career_clusters;` then re-run `03_seed_career_clusters_FINAL.sql`

### Endpoints Return Null
**Cause:** Edge Functions not finding data or schema mismatch
**Fix:** 
1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify table names in functions match database
3. Redeploy functions: `supabase functions deploy <name>`

### Frontend Build Fails
**Cause:** Network timeout or dependency issues
**Fix:**
1. Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules .next && npm install`
2. Try again with better network
3. Use `npm run build -- --force`

### Pages Show 404
**Cause:** Routes not registered or imports incorrect
**Fix:**
1. Verify imports in `App.tsx` match file names exactly
2. Check for typos in route paths
3. Restart dev server
