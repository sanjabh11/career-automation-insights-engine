# üöÄ EXECUTE NOW - Final Fix & Deploy

## üéØ Current Status
‚úÖ Career Clusters: 16 (FIXED)
‚úÖ Job Zones: 5 (WORKING)
‚úÖ Hot Technologies: 40 (WORKING)
üî¥ STEM: 2/100 (NEEDS FIX)

**Root Cause:** `onet_occupation_enrichment` table only has 2 records. STEM membership has 100 codes, but enrichment table doesn't have them.

**Solution:** Insert STEM occupations into enrichment table.

---

## ‚ö° Step 1: Fix STEM (2 minutes) - DO THIS NOW

### Open Supabase SQL Editor
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kvunnankqgfokeufvsrv/sql/new

### Copy & Run This Script
**File:** `supabase/data/imports/FINAL_STEM_FIX.sql`

```sql
-- Insert STEM occupations into enrichment table
INSERT INTO onet_occupation_enrichment (occupation_code, occupation_title, is_stem, data_source)
SELECT 
  sm.occupation_code,
  COALESCE(sm.occupation_title, 'STEM Occupation'),
  true,
  'STEM CSV Import'
FROM onet_stem_membership sm
WHERE sm.is_official_stem = true
ON CONFLICT (occupation_code) DO UPDATE SET
  is_stem = true,
  data_source = COALESCE(onet_occupation_enrichment.data_source, 'STEM CSV Import'),
  updated_at = NOW();

-- Verify
SELECT 'FINAL COUNTS' as status, 'STEM' as dataset, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM onet_occupation_enrichment WHERE is_stem = true
UNION ALL
SELECT 'FINAL COUNTS', 'Job Zones', COUNT(*) FROM onet_job_zones
UNION ALL
SELECT 'FINAL COUNTS', 'Career Clusters', COUNT(*) FROM onet_career_clusters
UNION ALL
SELECT 'FINAL COUNTS', 'Hot Technologies', COUNT(*) FROM onet_hot_technologies_master;
```

### Expected Result
```
| status       | dataset          | count |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----- |
| FINAL COUNTS | STEM             | 100   | ‚úÖ
| FINAL COUNTS | Job Zones        | 5     | ‚úÖ
| FINAL COUNTS | Career Clusters  | 16    | ‚úÖ
| FINAL COUNTS | Hot Technologies | 40    | ‚úÖ
```

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Test Endpoints (1 minute)

```bash
cd /Users/sanjayb/Documents/newrepo/career-automation-insights-engine
./test_endpoints.sh
```

### Expected Output
```
=== Testing STEM Filter ===
"db"
100

=== Testing Job Zones ===
"db"
5

=== Testing Hot Technologies ===
"db"
40

=== Testing Career Clusters ===
"db"
16
```

**If any show null:** Edge Functions may need redeployment
```bash
supabase functions deploy search-occupations
supabase functions deploy browse-job-zones
supabase functions deploy hot-technologies
supabase functions deploy browse-career-clusters
```
