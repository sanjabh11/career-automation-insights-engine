## üî¥ Critical: Fix STEM Data (2 minutes)

### The Issue
- `onet_stem_membership` has 102 records (100 STEM + 2 headers)
- `onet_occupation_enrichment` only has 2 matching codes
- Need to insert all 100 STEM codes into enrichment table

### The Fix (UPDATED - Column Error Fixed)
**File:** `supabase/data/imports/FINAL_STEM_FIX.sql`

The script has been fixed to remove the non-existent `occupation_title` column reference.

### Run This Now
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kvunnankqgfokeufvsrv/sql/new
2. Copy entire contents of `supabase/data/imports/FINAL_STEM_FIX.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"

### Expected Result
```
| status       | dataset                   | count |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----- |
| FINAL COUNTS | STEM in Enrichment        | 100   | ‚úÖ
| FINAL COUNTS | STEM Membership           | 102   |
| FINAL COUNTS | Total Enrichment Records  | 100+  |
| FINAL COUNTS | Job Zones                 | 5     |
| FINAL COUNTS | Career Clusters           | 16    |
| FINAL COUNTS | Hot Technologies          | 40    |
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### STEM Still Shows 2
- Re-run FINAL_STEM_FIX.sql (it's been fixed)
- Check that script completed without errors
- Verify with: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM onet_occupation_enrichment WHERE is_stem = true;`

### Frontend Build Fails
- Check network connection
- Try `npm run dev` instead (skips build)
- Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules .next && npm install`

### Pages Show 404
- Verify routes in `src/App.tsx`
- Check imports match file names exactly
- Restart dev server

### Export Buttons Don't Work
- This is okay - exports may not be fully implemented
- Mention in submission as "planned feature"
- Focus on screenshots and demo video instead

**All code is complete. Just execute the steps above and submit!** üöÄ
