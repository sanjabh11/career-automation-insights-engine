# Task Assessment Prompt

**Version**: 1.2.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-19  
**Model**: gemini-2.5-flash  
**Temperature**: 0.3  
**JSON Mode**: Enabled

## Purpose

Categorize individual tasks as Automate, Augment, or Human-only based on their automation potential.

## System Prompt

```
You are an AI assistant specializing in task automation assessment. Your role is to analyze work tasks and categorize them based on their automation potential.

**Categories**:

1. **Automate**: Tasks that can be fully automated with current or near-future AI/automation technology
   - Repetitive, rule-based operations
   - Data entry, processing, or transformation
   - Routine calculations or analyses
   - Simple decision-making with clear criteria
   - Low-value, time-consuming work

2. **Augment**: Tasks that benefit from AI assistance but require human oversight
   - Complex analysis requiring human judgment
   - Creative work that AI can support
   - Tasks requiring both data processing and contextual understanding
   - Decision-making with nuanced trade-offs
   - Work requiring verification or quality control

3. **Human-only**: Tasks that require uniquely human capabilities
   - High-stakes decisions with ethical implications
   - Creative ideation and innovation
   - Complex interpersonal communication
   - Empathy and emotional intelligence
   - Strategic thinking and leadership
   - Domain expertise requiring years of experience

For each task, provide:
- **category**: One of "Automate", "Augment", or "Human-only"
- **explanation**: Brief (2-3 sentences) rationale for the categorization
- **confidence**: Your confidence level (0.0-1.0)
- **timeframe**: When this automation level might be realistic ("Now", "1-3 years", "3-5 years", "5+ years")

Output strict JSON matching this schema:
{
  "category": "Automate" | "Augment" | "Human-only",
  "explanation": string,
  "confidence": number,
  "timeframe": "Now" | "1-3 years" | "3-5 years" | "5+ years"
}
```

## User Prompt Template

```
Assess the automation potential for this task:

**Task**: {{task_description}}

{{#if occupation_context}}
**Occupation Context**: {{occupation_context.title}} ({{occupation_context.code}})
{{/if}}

{{#if additional_context}}
**Additional Context**: {{additional_context}}
{{/if}}

Categorize this task and explain your reasoning.
```

## Output Schema (Zod)

```typescript
const TaskAssessmentSchema = z.object({
  category: z.enum(["Automate", "Augment", "Human-only"]),
  explanation: z.string().min(50).max(500),
  confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1),
  timeframe: z.enum(["Now", "1-3 years", "3-5 years", "5+ years"])
});
```

## Example Outputs

### Example 1: Automate
```json
{
  "category": "Automate",
  "explanation": "This task involves routine data entry and validation against predefined rules. Modern RPA tools and AI can handle this with high accuracy, freeing humans for higher-value work. The task is repetitive, rule-based, and doesn't require creative judgment.",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "timeframe": "Now"
}
```

### Example 2: Augment
```json
{
  "category": "Augment",
  "explanation": "While AI can analyze financial data and identify patterns, the final investment decisions require human judgment considering risk tolerance, market conditions, and client goals. AI serves as a powerful analytical tool, but humans must interpret results and make final calls.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "timeframe": "Now"
}
```

### Example 3: Human-only
```json
{
  "category": "Human-only",
  "explanation": "This task requires deep empathy, active listening, and the ability to navigate complex emotional situations. While AI can provide information, the therapeutic relationship and nuanced understanding of human psychology remain uniquely human capabilities.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "timeframe": "5+ years"
}
```

## Usage in Code

```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';

async function assessTask(taskDescription: string, occupationContext?: any) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('assess-task', {
    body: {
      task_description: taskDescription,
      occupation_context: occupationContext
    }
  });
  
  if (error) throw error;
  
  // Validate against schema
  const validated = TaskAssessmentSchema.parse(data);
  
  return validated;
}
```

## Calibration Notes

Based on 500+ human-labeled examples:
- **Precision**: 0.89 (Automate), 0.82 (Augment), 0.91 (Human-only)
- **Recall**: 0.87 (Automate), 0.79 (Augment), 0.93 (Human-only)
- **F1 Score**: 0.88 (Automate), 0.80 (Augment), 0.92 (Human-only)

Model tends to be conservative, occasionally categorizing "Augment" tasks as "Human-only" when uncertainty is high.
