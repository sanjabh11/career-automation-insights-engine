# PBI-0005-T3 Crosswalk Wizard UI

## Description
Build a React-based wizard UI to explore the `/crosswalk` Supabase edge function (live/cached). The wizard should allow users to choose a source taxonomy (SOC, MOC, CIP, ESCO, RAPIDS, DOT), enter a code, optionally select a target taxonomy, and render results with a sensible summary and access to raw JSON. Route should be available at `/crosswalk`.

## Requirements
- UI supports:
  - From taxonomy selector: SOC, MOC, CIP, ESCO, RAPIDS, DOT
  - Code input
  - Optional To taxonomy selector with "ALL" default
  - Submit/reset actions and loading state
- Uses `useCrosswalk` hook to call `/functions/v1/crosswalk` with query params
- Renders a summary list plus expandable raw JSON
- Add route `/crosswalk` in `App.tsx`

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement reusable hook `useCrosswalk` (React Query) to call edge function.
2. Create `CrosswalkWizard` component with form controls and results view.
3. Create `CrosswalkPage` to host the wizard and register `/crosswalk` route.
4. Wire to existing UI kit components for consistent styling.
5. Iteration 2 (post-approval): add richer layouts per target taxonomy and pagination if needed.

## Test Plan
- Unit: none required initially; basic render and query state verified via manual test.
- Manual:
  - Start dev server, navigate to `/crosswalk`.
  - Try SOC 15-1252 (or any known code) with To=ALL and individual targets.
  - Verify loading, error, and success states.

## Verification
- The page `/crosswalk` loads and returns mappings for valid inputs.
- Results show a concise per-item summary and raw JSON details.

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useCrosswalk.ts` (added)
- `src/components/CrosswalkWizard.tsx` (added)
- `src/pages/CrosswalkPage.tsx` (added)
- `src/App.tsx` (route added)
- `docs/delivery/PBI-0005/tasks.md` (task entry added)
