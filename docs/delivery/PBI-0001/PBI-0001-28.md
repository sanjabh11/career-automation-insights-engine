# PBI-0001-28: Guest Search Support (Local-First)

Type: code|ui
Status: InProgress

## Goal
Allow non-authenticated users to perform occupation search using the Netlify O*NET proxy with client-side, device-keyed rate limiting and local search history. Show a subtle banner suggesting sign-in for higher limits.

## Files
- `src/components/SearchInterface.tsx`
- `src/utils/device.ts` (new)

## Changes
- Permit searches in guest mode; remove hard stop that requires sign-in.
- Use a deviceId stored in localStorage as the rate-limit key when not authenticated.
- Record search history via unified hook (local for guests, remote for authed).
- Display a small inline notice encouraging sign-in for higher rate limits.

## Test Plan
1. Guest mode:
   - Can search; results render; local history increments.
   - Rate limiting applies with device key.
2. Authenticated mode:
   - Behavior unchanged; rate limit keyed by user id; remote history persists.
3. Banner:
   - Visible only when not authenticated.

## Rollback Plan
Revert edits to `SearchInterface.tsx` and delete `src/utils/device.ts`.
