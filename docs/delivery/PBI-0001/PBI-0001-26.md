# PBI-0001-26: CSV Export for Saved Analyses (Client-only)

Type: code
Status: InProgress

## Goal
Provide a client-only CSV export for the current user's (guest/local or authenticated/remote) saved analyses.

## Files
- `src/utils/export.ts` (new)
- `src/components/SavedAnalysesPanel.tsx` (add Export CSV button)

## Changes
- Implement `exportAnalysesToCSV(analyses, filename)` that creates a CSV and triggers a download via Blob.
- Add an "Export CSV" button to `SavedAnalysesPanel` that exports the list visible in the panel using the unified hook data.

## Test Plan
1. As guest: Create a few local saved analyses and click Export CSV. Verify file downloads and contents contain rows.
2. As authenticated user: Ensure remote saved analyses export works.
3. CSV fields: id, occupation_code, occupation_title, tags (comma-joined), created_at, updated_at.

## Rollback Plan
Remove the export utility and button.
