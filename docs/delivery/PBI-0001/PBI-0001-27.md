# PBI-0001-27: Comparison View for Saved Analyses

Type: code
Status: InProgress

## Goal
Allow users to select two saved analyses (local or remote) and view a side-by-side comparison.

## Files
- `src/pages/ComparePage.tsx` (new)
- `src/App.tsx` (add route `/compare`)

## Changes
- Build a page that uses `useSavedAnalysesUnified()` to list saved analyses and allows choosing up to two for comparison.
- Show side-by-side cards with core fields: occupation title/code, tags, notes, dates. (Extend later to show computed APO fields when present.)

## Test Plan
1. With a few saved analyses in local mode, open `/compare` and select 2 items. Verify side-by-side details render.
2. In authenticated mode with remote records, confirm the same behavior.
3. Edge case: selecting more than 2 shows an inline notice to deselect one.

## Rollback Plan
Remove `ComparePage.tsx` and the route entry in `src/App.tsx`.
