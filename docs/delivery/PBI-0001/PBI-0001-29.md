# PBI-0001-29: PDF Export (Client-only via Print-Friendly HTML)

Type: code
Status: InProgress

## Goal
Allow users to export saved analyses to a print-friendly HTML and use the browser's "Save as PDF" for a portable report.

## Files
- `src/utils/export.ts`
- `src/components/SavedAnalysesPanel.tsx`

## Changes
- Add `exportAnalysesToPrintableHTML(analyses, title?)` utility that opens a new window with minimal CSS and a table of analyses, then calls `print()`.
- Add an "Export PDF" button next to "Export CSV" in SavedAnalysesPanel, triggering the printable view.

## Test Plan
1. As guest and as authenticated user, click "Export PDF" and ensure the print dialog opens with a nicely formatted report.
2. Verify fields shown: title, code, tags, created_at, updated_at.
3. Check that long lists paginate correctly in the print preview.

## Rollback Plan
Remove the button and the utility function.
