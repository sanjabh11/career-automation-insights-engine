# PBI-0001-31: Accessibility & Performance Checklist

Type: doc
Status: InProgress

## Goal
Define a short, actionable checklist to keep accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and performance (<3s TTI target) in every PR.

## Checklist (run on each feature PR)
- [ ] Lighthouse (Desktop + Mobile) >= 90 perf, >= 90 a11y on the page(s) changed
- [ ] Color contrast of text/icons passes AA
- [ ] Focus states visible on interactive elements; tab order logical
- [ ] Forms have labels/aria attributes; error states announced
- [ ] Images have alt text or are aria-hidden when decorative
- [ ] Reduce unused JS; code-split when feasible; avoid unbounded effects
- [ ] Network: cache/static headers correct; avoid blocking fonts; lazy-load heavy modules
- [ ] Verify CSP headers allow only necessary origins

## How to run quickly
- Use Chrome Lighthouse (incognito) on changed screens
- Keyboard-only walkthrough (Tab/Shift+Tab) to confirm focus and ARIA
- Quick contrast check on primary text against backgrounds

## Next
- Optional: add a lightweight CI job for Lighthouse on key routes
