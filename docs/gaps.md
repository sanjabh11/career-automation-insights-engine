***

## **Step-by-Step Checks**

- Bright Outlook and STEM: Searched O*NET for both; filters work there, only show as basic lists on APO Explorer, with minimal filter/discovery UX.
- Hot Technology/Tech Skills: Used “Python” on O*NET, produced mapped jobs with demand index; in APO, clicking exemplars has no effect, no list populates.
- Task/Duty search: O*NET supports combine/compare, APO only implements keyword text match.
- Related Activities: O*NET DWA selection/export flows work, APO displays activities for a job but has no cross-job journey or export tools.
- Soft Skills: Survey and job-mapping flows in O*NET, absent in APO.
- CIP/Education: Selected computer science in O*NET, returned full occupation+program crosswalk, cost, and export. In APO, only basic mapping wizard exists.
- Zone ladders: O*NET displays all zones, export and group; APO: All zone routes 404.
- Work/Dimensional browse: O*NET folders and drill-down layered browsing per dimension; APO: Dimension tab and select, little detail/interactivity.
- Crosswalks: All code mappings in O*NET; limited to SOC/CIP/MOC in APO.
- RIASEC/Profiler: Not present in APO.
- Veterans/MOC: O*NET gives tailored flows, occupations, skills mapped per branch; APO is basic code-to-job match only, no export.
- Industry: O*NET NAICS dashboards load; APO: Sectoral view absent.
- Helpdesk: O*NET Desk Aid/Help overlays in app/menu; APO: Only generic docs, no in-app overlays.

***

**Summary:**  
- O*NET delivers all critical discovery, filtering, clustering, mapping, skill, and help overlays.
- APO Explorer covers the main automation pipeline, model explainability, and basic skill/job mapping, but **lacks almost all high-leverage judge-facing cohort/UX/skill/lattice/portfolio features** listed above.
- **Immediate roadmap priority:** Implement/restore cohort/zone ladders, tech skill mappings, Bright Outlook/STEM filtering, and soft skill/interest/industry flows. Surface parity and add interactive help.
======
2- Proposed Implementation Plan To be re-verified and improved before implementation.
 
Here is a **focused, step-by-step, comprehensive implementation plan** to close every major feature gap between your platform and O*NET OnLine, with award impact and judge-readiness in mind.

***

## **Implementation Plan for All Key Gaps Identified**

### **1. Bright Outlook Filters & Badges**
**Gap:** No explicit Bright Outlook discovery/filter, no integrated badges in pipelines/paths.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data Ingestion:** Import Bright Outlook fields (Rapid Growth, Numerous Openings, New/Emerging) as boolean flags in your occupation DB.
- **b. UI:**  
  - Add Bright Outlook filter chips to Occupation Search, Tech Skills, and Education Path tabs.
  - Display small trend badges (color-coded) beside titles and pipeline breakdowns.
- **c. Learning Path Integration:**  
  - Prioritize Bright Outlook occupations in recommendations.
  - Annotate upskilling ladders with Outlook-aware opportunities.
- **d. Demo-Ready Evidence:**  
  - Build/feature 3 preloaded “Bright Outlook” upskilling scenarios with clear badge display/options.
  - Storyboard a 1-click PDF export showing “future-ready” pipeline screenshots.

***

### **2. STEM Tagging, Dashboards, and Ladders**
**Gap:** No STEM filter, clustering, or custom pipelines.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data Update:** Tag each occupation by STEM, using O*NET’s code definitions.
- **b. UI:**  
  - Add STEM filter chips and STEM Only toggle to search, planner, and outcomes/cohort dashboards.
  - Create static dashboards: 1 per STEM mega-cluster (e.g., CompSci, Health, Engineering) showing major upskilling ladders.
- **c. Pathways:**  
  - Within “Planner,” highlight STEM-specific education ladders, break learning plans by Job Zone, and prepopulate STEM exemplars.
- **d. Demo Evidence:**  
  - Static storyline: three STEM cluster journeys, each with path, time, cost, and upskilling summary.

***

### **3. Tech Skills Search & Hot Technology Mappings**
**Gap:** Hot Tech UI but missing data, no occupation mapping, no “heat index” analytics.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data Integration:**  
  - Import Hot Technology/Tech Skills lists (O*NET codes) and map occupations to each technology.
  - Collect and normalize heat index from job postings (Lightcast or O*NET).
- **b. Search UI:**  
  - Tech Search accepts tool names, maps to jobs with demand index.
  - “Heat index” bar or chips for each match.
- **c. Learning Links:**  
  - For each tool, add “find courses” linkages (e.g., Python → Python courses).
- **d. Demo**:  
  - Demo three skills (Excel, Python, Salesforce) showing occupation demand, heat, sample path to upskilling; export as CSV.

***

### **4. Duty/Task Semantic Search via Embeddings**
**Gap:** Only text/keyword task search present; no multi-task, similarity, or profile-driven matching.

**Plan:**
- **a. Embeddings Pipeline:**  
  - Use OpenAI or local model to produce vector embeddings for O*NET detailed tasks/DWAs and user-entered/selected statements.
- **b. Backend:**  
  - Expose vector-based semantic search API.
- **c. UI:**  
  - Let users select multiple duties; show similarity-ranked occupation matches including automate/augment/human labels.
- **d. Demo Evidence:**  
  - Preload 2–3 “profiled” task lists and show AI-matched occupation/skill-path results.

***

### **5. Related Activities (DWAs) Visualization & Export**
**Gap:** No DWA filters, pathway viz, or export functions.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data:**  
  - Link each occupation and task to detailed work activities (DWAs).
- **b. UI:**  
  - Add DWA selection + similarity/journey mapping tool on Task Search page.
  - Add export buttons (PDF/CSV) for “My Activity Journey.”
- **c. Demo:**  
  - Show canned DWA journeys for 2–3 careers with export artifacts for judge packs.

***

### **6. Soft Skills Builder & Mapping**
**Gap:** No survey or soft-skill to occupation mapping; no “coaching tips.”

**Plan:**
- **a. Survey:**  
  - Create single-page soft skills survey (select/interact, O*NET list).
- **b. Match:**  
  - For each skill selected, fetch matching jobs, skills, short courses, and coach tips (“build negotiation—take this LinkedIn course”).
- **c. Demo:**  
  - Simulated 3-user cohort with occupation outcomes and skill map.

***

### **7. CIP/Education Program Crosswalk Enhancements**
**Gap:** No linked program catalogs, cost/duration analytics embedded in upskilling path.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data:**  
  - Import program titles, costs, durations, outcomes for major SOC↔CIP pairs.
- **b. Path UI:**  
  - Embed these as recommendation cards (cost/time/who should take) in Education Planner.
  - Add download/export for comparison PDF/CSV.
- **c. Evidence:**  
  - Take 10 program exemplars and make an “education forecasting” KPI sheet.

***

### **8. Job Zone Ladders & Timeline Visuals**
**Gap:** No zone-by-zone upskilling ladders, no cluster demos.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data:**  
  - Map all jobs to Job Zone in DB.
- **b. UI:**  
  - Add /zones page (or dashboard section) with ladder visualization and zone-based path ROI.
  - Ladder: Zone 2 → Zone 3 → Zone 4 → target, showing time/cost and skills required for transition.
- **c. Demo:**  
  - Static ladder for three key careers; screenshots/videos for presentation.

***

### **9. Enhanced Dimension-First Discovery**
**Gap:** No deep, interactive browsing by Abilities/Knowledge/Context; static only.

**Plan:**
- **a. Hierarchy nav:**  
  - Follow O*NET drill-down style per dimension, add filter by importance.
- **b. UX:**  
  - Show how each trait contributes to APO; add “Find training”/learning resource links at each node.
- **c. Evidence:**  
  - Screenshots of factor explorer and training connection.

***

### **10. Crosswalk Expansion (OOH/DOT/RAPIDS/ESCO)**
**Gap:** Only SOC/CIP/MOC mapped; others missing.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data load:**  
  - Import crosswalk CSVs; add normalized lookup/mapper utilities.
- **b. UI:**  
  - Enhance Crosswalk Explorer page with tabs for each code type and “nearest-match” queries.
- **c. Demo:**  
  - Static demo sheet of mapped journeys by three code types.

***

### **11. Interest Profiler (RIASEC-lite)**
**Gap:** No RIASEC (interest) profiler.

**Plan:**
- **a. Frontend quiz:**  
  - Build 12–20 question RIASEC assessment; output hex profile.
- **b. Matching:**  
  - Overlay profiles on list of careers with risk/ROI/edu path suggestions.
- **c. Demo:**  
  - Sample simulated students; screenshots, fit overlays, and education planner combos.

***

### **12. Veterans UX (MOC Flow)**
**Gap:** Entry-level mapping, but not guided, branch-specific, or exportable.

**Plan:**
- **a. Guided flow:**  
  - Ask for branch, code (MOS/etc.), auto-transition through occupation map → skill gap → matched education path and payback estimate.
- **b. Export:**  
  - One-click PDF/CSV journey.
- **c. Demo:**  
  - Preload 3 MOC-to-civilian journeys.

***

### **13. Industry Dashboards**
**Gap:** No sector/NAICS slice by job, share, or education upskilling.

**Plan:**
- **a. Data:**  
  - Map occupations to NAICS codes, bring in employment share/growth data.
- **b. Analytics View:**  
  - Sector tab: top jobs by share, education/skills needed, and growth forecasts.
- **c. Demo:**  
  - Static dashboards for Healthcare, IT, Education.

***

### **14. Inline Help, Desk Aid, and Why Panels**
**Gap:** Help only as doc, no overlays or evidence trail.

**Plan:**
- **a. Inline overlay:**  
  - Add mini-help (“?” button) to all main widgets and cohort/progression screens.
  - Panel/tour: Explain “why recommended,” evidence artifacts, and weights for nominations.
- **b. Link Desk Aid PDF and video overlay in each section.

***

### **15. Occupations Parity Checker**
**Gap:** No parity/audit tooling.

**Plan:**
- **a. Tool:**  
  - Build nightly title/code listing and diff log pages.
- **b. Evidence:**  
  - Expose (or link) parity report to judges.

***

### **Sequencing Advice**
- **Sprint 1:** Bright Outlook, STEM, and Hot Tech—clustered filters, search, and badges
- **Sprint 2:** Tech→Occupation→Education mapping and learning ladders (Job Zone); DWA visualization, Soft Skills, and basic RIASEC
- **Sprint 3:** Parity checker, crosswalk tabs, advanced veterans UX, industry dashboards
- **Sprint 4:** Inline overlays/help, deep dimension browsing, export/print demo artifacts

**Judge Demo Tip:**  
Pre-build 2–3 “Tours” showing user journeys end-to-end using new features with exportable results and artifacts for review.

## O*NET vs APO Explorer: Live Comparison Table

| Feature     | O*NET (Reference) – Sample/Outcome                           | APO Explorer – Value Tested/Outcome                         | Gaps/Recommendations |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Bright Outlook** | Searched [Bright Outlook](https://www.onetonline.org/find/bright?b=1), e.g., “Accountants and Auditors”, “Actuaries”, “Acute Care Nurses” show up. 100+ listed with jobs and codes. | `/browse/bright-outlook` – Zero results regardless of filter (Category, Job Zone, Wage). Parity counter = 0. | **Urgent:** Fix population/fallback. What should appear: Lists of jobs like “Accountants and Auditors”, “Actuaries”. FAQ: Data ingestion/Edge fallback is not working—verify DB, fetch, env secrets. |
| **STEM Dashboard** | Searched [STEM](https://www.onetonline.org/find/stem?t=1): e.g., “Aerospace Engineers”, “Computer Programmers”, “Registered Nurses” visible in each cluster. 50+ listed. | `/browse/stem` – Only a couple of STEM jobs appear. Chips/family filters work, but almost empty list in main table. | **Urgent:** Sync/seed STEM membership data. What should appear: Dozens of STEM jobs matching clusters. FAQ: Use O*NET official CSV for mapping. |
| **Hot Technologies** | Searched [Hot Tech](https://www.onetonline.org/search/hot_tech/): e.g., “Python”: Matches 60+ jobs (“Data Scientist”, “Software Developer”), plus actual employer demand (postings column). | `/tech-skills` – Chips (“Python”, etc.) present, all mapped jobs = 0. “Fetch Courses” returns nothing. | **Urgent:** Fill `onet_hot_technologies_master` and mapping tables; ensure fallback yields jobs per chip. What should appear: Each chip yields actual job count and demand index, course links active. |
| **Job Zones** | [Job Zone 3](https://www.onetonline.org/find/zone?z=3): 80+ jobs (“Administrative Services Managers”, “Bookkeeping, Accounting, and Auditing Clerks”, etc.) rendered; all zones have rich lists. | `/browse/job-zones` – Ladder/zone UI visible, no jobs for any zone; every list = 0. | **Urgent:** Load job zone mapping DB, check zone code parser. What should appear: Occupations per zone with codes/titles; ladders auto-fill. |
| **Multi-Duty Task Match** | Custom task search for “Software Developer” → similar jobs (FTS) by task. E.g., input **Write code documentation; Implement APIs; Analyze system performance** yields “Software Quality Assurance Analyst”, “Data Scientist”, “SysAdmin”, etc. | `/task-match` – Entered 3 lines, clicked Match: **No results, no feedback.** | **High:** Fix FTS edge function/results plumbing. What should appear: Ranked jobs by match, with download/export. |
| **Task DWA/Journey Export** | Can build DWA list, export matches (“Analyze requirements”, “Write code”, etc. as CSV). | `/work-dimensions` – Can export CSV of selected activities (journey). | **OK:** Export worked; viz could be more interactive. |
| **Soft Skills Builder** | Survey, select “Negotiation”, “Active Listening” and see mapped jobs. Exportable. | `/skills-builder` – Sliders, weight/save, results show 3+ courses. | **OK:** Works for basic flow; tie each soft skill to job search results as next enhancement. |
| **Veterans Mapping** | Entered “11B” (Infantryman): 15+ matched roles, mapped skills, exportable path. | `/veterans` – Entered “11B”, mapping works, learning path button (if logged in). | **OK:** Suggest further polish (custom branch/journey export). |
| **CIP/Education Xwalk** | CIP code “11.0701” (“Computer Science”): shows 20+ related programs/jobs, with detailed cost, duration, and export. | `/education` – Mapped, “Fetch Programs” yields minimal list, CSV works. | **Medium:** Add detailed program data (costs, time, outcomes). |
| **Parities/Admin Counts** | O*NET: 1,016 occupations. | `/admin/parity` – Shows counts for all, Bright Outlook, STEM. | **OK:** Automate scheduled O*NET parity checks for judges. |
| **Interest Profiler** | Full 18Q quiz, RIASEC profile, matched jobs. | `/profiler` – Quiz appears, produces results. | **OK:** Add career overlays/action links for more value. |

## Recommendations for Dev Team

- **Data Ingestion:** Re-seed and live fetch pipelines for Bright Outlook, STEM, Tech Skills, and Job Zones (pull O*NET CSV daily/weekly).
- **Immediate Fix:** Validate DB tables for each major cohort, ensure mapping completeness for jobs/zones/tags.
- **Edge Functions:** Confirm O*NET env variables live, debug current edge function responses for FTS and population issues.
- **Feedback/Logging:** Show error or “no results found” feedback, not silent fail, for empty lists/match attempts.
- **Export Consistency:** Maintain export/download consistency with O*NET for journeys, mapping, custom lists.
Here is a precise, point-by-point verification of each implemented feature based on live page refresh, direct interaction, and test values at http://localhost:8080, with a **gap analysis and priority** for every claim:

***

## **High Priority Checks**

### 1. **Bright Outlook Data + Parity + Badges**
- **Test:** Visited `/browse/bright-outlook`, toggled all filters, verified baths/badges/help overlays.
- **Result:** **UI works but no occupation data loads** (0 results, parity 0).
- **Gap:** Data fallback or ingestion not functioning—no real results. **High priority** to fix data pipeline or verify O*NET credentials/API.
***

### 2. **Task Search: Multi-Duty (Semantic-Like)**
- **Test:** Used `/task-match`, entered 3 duty lines, clicked "Match."
- **Result:** **No results, no error message, button seems to do nothing**.
- **Gap:** Edge function or UI not returning or handling results. **High priority** to fix aggregation logic or backend.
***

### 3. **Job Zone Ladders**
- **Test:** On `/browse/job-zones`, toggled Zones 1–5, inspected ladder panels and CSV export.
- **Result:** **Ladder UI/columns present, but lists are empty ("0 occupations" in every zone).**
- **Gap:** Ladder code renders but database results missing. **High priority** to seed or repair occupation pipeline.
***

### 4. **Hot Tech (Tech Skills) with Fallbacks**
- **Test:** Clicked `/tech-skills`, interacted with chips/cards, tried "Fetch Courses".
- **Result:** **Page loads, chips visible, but all jobs/heat metrics = 0; course fetch untested (if chips empty).**
- **Gap:** Backend fallback for hot tech/occupations isn’t populating. **High priority** to seed DB or update hot tech master.
***

### 5. **STEM Dashboard Feel**
- **Test:** On `/browse/stem`, summary chips rendered, top-type/family visible, filtered jobs.
- **Result:** **Page functional, summary chips/indicators work, but few actual STEM jobs listed.**
- **Gap:** STEM tagging coverage is low/incomplete. **High priority** to sync/migrate DB for coverage/parity.

***

## **Medium Priority Checks**

### 6. **Task/DWA Journey Export**
- **Test:** Selected "Work Activities" in `/work-dimensions`, checked and exported journey.
- **Result:** **Export button works, CSV downloads. Selection state retained.**
- **Gap:** Export works, but journey viz is basic. **Medium priority** for path visualization.

***

### 7. **Soft Skills Courses**
- **Test:** On `/skills-builder`, rated skills, top gaps suggest courses.
- **Result:** **Works: 3–6 course suggestions visible.**
- **Gap:** Limited to basic LinkedIn/Coursera links, no deep mapping. **Medium priority** for finer personalization.

***

### 8. **Veterans Flow/Export + Learning Path**
- **Test:** `/veterans`, entered MOS (e.g., "11B"), tried "Generate Learning Path."
- **Result:** **Mapping loads, export/learning path possible if logged in.**
- **Gap:** Flow functional, polish pending. **Medium priority** for more customized exports.

***

### 9. **CIP/Education Crosswalk + Programs Export**
- **Test:** `/education`, entered CIP, ran map/fetch programs, exported CSV.
- **Result:** **Basic flows work, but limited program results/data depth.**
- **Gap:** Needs richer program/cost integration. **Medium priority**.

***

## **Low Priority Checks**

### 10. **Crosswalk Tabs (DOT, RAPIDS)**
- **Test:** `/crosswalk`, switched tabs.
- **Result:** **Tabs present, UI elements display, coverage limited by data.**
- **Gap:** Smaller, data/backfill needed. **Low priority**.

***

### 11. **Interest Profiler (RIASEC)**
- **Test:** `/profiler` route, answered questions.
- **Result:** **Profiler loads, RIASEC code produced, links present.**
- **Gap:** Output exists; more result mapping possible. **Low priority**.

***

### 12. **Industry Dashboard**
- **Test:** `/industry` page, picked clusters.
- **Result:** **Dashboard works, top jobs viewable, export appears.**
- **Gap:** Works as proxy, NAICS-matching polish. **Low priority**.

***

### 13. **Admin Parity Page**
- **Test:** `/admin/parity`, checked counts.
- **Result:** **Page loads, meaningful counts for All, Bright, STEM, zones.**
- **Gap:** Works; extend for judge artifact. **Low priority**.

***

### 14. **Help Overlays/Inline Why**
- **Test:** On major pages (Tech Skills, Bright Outlook, Work Dimensions), triggered HelpOverlay.
- **Result:** **Help overlays work; rationale visible; Desk Aid not tested.**
- **Gap:** Works, links could be added. **Low priority**.
