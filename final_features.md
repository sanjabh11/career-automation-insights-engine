  initial_salary INTEGER,
  goal_occupation VARCHAR(255),
  
  -- 90-day follow-up
  completed_learning_hours INTEGER,
  skills_acquired TEXT[],
  
  -- 180-day follow-up
  transitioned BOOLEAN,
  new_salary INTEGER,
  transition_months INTEGER,
  satisfaction_score INTEGER,
  
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Auto-prompt after 90 days
SELECT cron.schedule('outcome-survey-prompt', '0 0 * * *', 
  'SELECT send_outcome_survey(user_id) FROM users WHERE created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL ''90 days'''
);
```

**What This Enables for Awards:**
```
"Real User Outcomes (3-month pilot):
‚Ä¢ 28 users tracked

## **‚ùå WHAT NOT TO BUILD (Low Award Impact)**

These are good features but **won't move the needle for judges**:

| Feature | Why Skip for Award | Build Later? |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **BLS Regional Toggle** | Marginal calibration; judges won't notice | Yes, post-award |
| **GitHub Tech Momentum** | Nice-to-have telemetry; not core USP | Yes, post-award |
| **WEF Maturity Chips** | Provenance signal, but redundant with O*NET citation | Maybe |
| **Benchmark Delta vs Experts** | Valuable but time-intensive; judges trust O*NET | Phase 2 |
| **Commitment Reminders** | Retention feature, not demo-worthy | Yes, for users |
| **Rebalancing Planner Polish** | Incremental UX; portfolio core is sufficient | Polish later |
| **Efficient Frontier Stub** | Cool visual, but optional if portfolio optimizer strong | Nice-to-have |
